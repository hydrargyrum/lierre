Lierre - tag-based email client
===============================

Lierre is a graphical email client written in Python with PyQt5. It is tag-based instead of folder based.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, it leverages many existing tools like:
* notmuch
* mbsync, offlineimap, etc.
* msmtp, sendmail, etc.
* pass, seahorse, etc.
